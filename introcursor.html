<H1>CURSORS IN PL/SQL</H1>

<P>In the context of databases and SQL, a cursor is a database object used to retrieve and manipulate data from a result set returned by a SQL query. Cursors provide a way to iterate over the rows of a result set one at a time, enabling programmatic control over data retrieval and manipulation. Here's an explanation of cursors:</P>

<H1>TWO TYPES OF CURSORS:
    <P>1.IMPLICIT CURSOR<BR>
    2.EXPLICIT CURSOR</P>
</H1>

<H1>ATTRIBUTES OF CURSORS:</H1>

    <H1>BASIC FUNCTIONALITY:</H1>
    <P>nitialization : Cursors are initialized with a SQL query that defines the result set to be processed.<BR></P>

       <P>Execution : After initialization, the cursor is executed, and the query is executed against the database to fetch the result set.<BR></P>
        
       
        <P>   Iteration : Cursors allow the program to fetch rows from the result set one at a time. The cursor keeps track of the current position within the result set.<BR></P>
        
        <P> Processing : Each fetched row can be processed individually within the program. This includes reading the values of columns, performing calculations, and executing further logic based on the row's data.<BR></P>
        
            <P> Termination : Cursors are typically closed once all rows in the result set have been processed. Closing the cursor releases associated resources and frees up database server memory.<BR></P>

<H1>CURSOR OPERATION:</H1>

<P><U>Opening :</U> The cursor is opened to execute the associated SQL query and fetch the result set.<BR>

 <U>  Fetching :</U> Rows from the result set are retrieved one by one using the FETCH statement. Each fetch operation advances the cursor to the next row.<BR>
    
    <U>Closing : </U> all rows have been processed, or when no longer needed, the cursor is closed using the CLOSE statement. This releases database resources associated with the cursor.</P>
