<H1>WHAT IS PL/SQL?</H1>
<P>PL/SQL, or Procedural Language/Structured Query Language, is a powerful extension of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for creating stored procedures, functions, triggers, and more within Oracle databases. It combines the flexibility of SQL with the procedural functionality of programming languages like C</P>

<H1>FUNDAMENTALS OF PL/SQL:</H1>

<P>Procedural Capabilities : PL/SQL allows developers to write procedural code, enabling them to control the flow of execution, use variables, loops, conditional statements, and exception handling. This makes it more versatile than SQL for complex data manipulation tasks.</P>

<P>Stored Procedures and Functions : PL/SQL enables the creation of stored procedures and functions, which are named PL/SQL blocks stored in the database. Stored procedures can perform a series of SQL operations and return results, while functions return a single value. These can be reused across different parts of an application, improving code modularity and maintainability.</P>

<P>Triggers : Triggers are PL/SQL blocks associated with tables or views in a database. They automatically execute in response to specific events, such as inserting, updating, or deleting data from the associated table. Triggers are commonly used for enforcing business rules, maintaining data integrity, and auditing changes.</P>

<P>Exception Handling : PL/SQL provides robust mechanisms for handling exceptions that may occur during program execution. Developers can define exception handlers to gracefully handle errors, log information, and ensure the stability of the application.</P>

<P>Variables and Data Types : PL/SQL supports variables and data types similar to most programming languages. Developers can declare variables to hold data temporarily within a PL/SQL block, assigning values and performing operations on them as needed.</P>

<P>Dynamic SQL : PL/SQL allows the execution of dynamic SQL statements, where SQL queries are constructed and executed dynamically at runtime. This flexibility is useful for scenarios where the structure of the SQL statement is not known until runtime, such as building queries based on user input or runtime conditions.
